# **FoodVision: AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions from Fridge Images**  

## **Problem Statement**  
Many people struggle with deciding what to cook based on the ingredients they have. Food waste is a major issue, and manually searching for recipes that match available ingredients can be time-consuming. Additionally, people with specific dietary restrictions or calorie goals often find it difficult to filter recipes that align with their needs.  

## **How is it Useful?**  
- **Reduces Food Waste**: Helps users utilize available ingredients efficiently, minimizing waste.  
- **Saves Time**: Eliminates the need for manual recipe searches by providing instant, AI-driven suggestions.  
- **Personalized Meal Planning**: Adapts to user preferences, including dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, keto, gluten-free) and calorie goals.  
- **Enhances Creativity**: Suggests diverse meal ideas and even generates new recipes based on ingredient combinations.  
- **Health-Conscious Recommendations**: Ensures meals align with calorie limits and nutritional needs.  

## **Business Logic**  
1. **Image Recognition**: The app processes an image of the fridge using AI to detect and classify visible ingredients.  
2. **Ingredient Processing with LLM**:  
   - The identified ingredients are fed into a Large Language Model (LLM), which suggests relevant recipes based on available items.  
   - The LLM considers:  
     - **User dietary restrictions** (e.g., vegan, low-carb, nut-free).  
     - **Calorie requirements**, filtering or adjusting recipes accordingly.  
     - **Cuisine preferences** (e.g., Italian, Asian, Mediterranean).  
     - **Cooking constraints** (e.g., quick meals, one-pot dishes).  
3. **Smart Recipe Generation & Enhancement**:  
   - If no exact match is found, the LLM can generate new recipes based on ingredient combinations and culinary knowledge.  
   - The model suggests substitutions for missing ingredients or healthier alternatives.  
4. **Nutritional Breakdown**:  
   - The app calculates approximate calorie counts for each suggested recipe.  
   - Users can modify portions or ingredients to better fit their dietary goals.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React Native (cross-platform mobile app)  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **AI & Image Processing**:  
  - **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, or Google Vision API for ingredient recognition  
  - **Recipe Suggestion**: Large Language Model (LLM) such as OpenAI's GPT, Llama, or a fine-tuned transformer model  
  - **NLP-Based Ingredient Matching**: Utilizing embeddings (e.g., BERT, FAISS) for ingredient-recipe mapping  
  - **Calorie & Nutrition Analysis**: Nutrition API (e.g., Edamam, USDA API) or LLM-based estimation  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing recipes, dietary preferences, and user history  
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for storing fridge images  
- **Hosting & API Services**: AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions for serverless execution
